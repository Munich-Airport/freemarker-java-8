# freemarker-java-8
Java library for adding support for new Java 8 APIs in FreeMarker. At the moment this includes support for the new java.time API.

# Note

This library is in its early days. We are not sure where we will go with this yet. It is made public available to encourage discussions about the implementation. Hopefully FreeMarker will support the Java 8 date/time api in the future. Meanwhile we need a library like this (or something better if you contribute).
