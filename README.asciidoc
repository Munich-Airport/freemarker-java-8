# freemarker-java-8

This is a tiny Java library that adds basic support for the new Java 8 date/time api in FreeMarker.
Unfortunately FreeMarker doesn't support formatting the output of these classes, and there are no current plans for
adding this at the moment (http://freemarker.org/contribute.html).
But hopefully we will se this support soon, but in the meantime we need to find pragmatic ways around it.
 
If anybody is interested, we can make the library available in the Central Maven Repository.
But this will only be done upon request. Please create an issue if you would like to contribute or use the package.
 
## java.time support

The library has basic support for all classes in the java.time api introduced in Java 8. This means that you are able
to print their values within a template, and also format the output for those classes that supports formatting with the
new +java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter+

More documentation will be added soon.
