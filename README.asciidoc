# freemarker-java-8

This is a tiny Java library that adds basic support the new Java 8 date/time api to FreeMarker.
Unfortunately FreeMarker doesn't support this, and there are no current plans for adding this either.
Hopefully we will se this support soon, but in the meantime we need to find pragmatic ways around it.
 
If any intereset, we can make the library available in the Central Maven Repository. But this will only be done if 
anyone is interested. Please create an issue if you would like to contribute or use the package.
 
## java.time support

The library has basic support for all classes in the java.time api introduced in Java 8. This means that you are able
to print their values within a template, and also format the output for those classes that supports formatting with the
new +java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter+
